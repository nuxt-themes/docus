# Deployment

Deploy your documentation with Docus to any static hosting. 🚀

---

To generate the documentation for production, run the following command:

::code-group

  ```bash [Yarn]
  yarn build
  ```

  ```bash [NPM]
  npm run build
  ```

::

The build command creates a `.output` directory with all your application, server and content ready for production.

## Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) has Git-based Deployment that will continuously deploy every time you push to main (or whatever branch you choose).

Just click on the below button and import your project into Netlify.

Netlify will detect that you are using Docus and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.
