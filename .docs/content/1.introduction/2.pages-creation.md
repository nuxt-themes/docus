# Content creation

Docus is built on top of [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org) MDC syntax to level-up the developer experience in content writing.


To create pages start start by creating markdown files in `content/` directory. All your content automatically become pages in your website.

| File | Internal path |
| ----------------- | :-------- |
| `content/index.md` | `/` |
| `content/about.md` | `/about` |
| `content/blog/index.md` | `/blog` |
| `content/blog/hello.md` | `/blog/hello` |
| `content/1.guide/2.installation` | `/guide/installation` |
