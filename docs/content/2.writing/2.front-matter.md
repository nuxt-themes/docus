# Front-matter

> Easily configure the rendering of your Markdown pages. 📝

Front-matter is used to transmit data to your components and templates, from any page or directory.

## Native parameters

Docus core and default theme includes a lot of native parameters that you can already use to configure your pages.

| Key | Type | Description |
|---------|--------| -----|
| `title` | `String` | Title of the page (will also be injected in metas) |
| `description` | `String` | Description of the page, will be added below the title and injected into the metas |
| `version` | `Float` | Alert users that the page is new with a badge. Once the page is seen, the version is stored in localStorage and the badge won't be shown again until the version is incremented  |
| `badge` | `String` | Adds a badge next to the page title |
| `position` | `Number` | Position of the page within the category. By default we use the filename prefix `POSITION.`, example: `1.first-page.md` |
| `draft` | `Boolean` | Mark the page as draft (and only display it in development mode). By default we use the filename suffix `.draft`, example: `3.my-draft-page.draft.md` |
| `head` | `Object` | Add the HTML Head tags for the current page. The structure of head property is same as [Nuxt head method](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/components-glossary/pages-head/) but in YAML syntax. To know the list of options you can give to head, take a look at [vue-meta documentation](https://vue-meta.nuxtjs.org/api/#metainfo-properties) |
| **Navigation** | | |
| `navigation` | `false \| Object` | If set to `false`, the page will not display in Docus navigation menus and Next/Prev links |
| `navigation.title` | `String` | If set, overrides the title that will be displayed in navigation menus |
| `navigation.nested`| `Boolean`| If set to `false`, the nested pages will not display in Docus navigation menus |
| `navigation.exclusive` | `Boolean` | If set to `true`, other pages will not show in the left menu when user visiting the page or its nested pages. |
| **Table of Contents** | | |
| `toc` | `false \| object` | If set to `false`, it will disable the table of contents generation. |
| `toc.title` | `String` | If set, overrides the title of table of contents section. |
| `toc.depth` | `Number` | Determine the depth of generated TOC. Default value is `2`, which mean only detect `h2` and `h3` tags. |

## Shortcuts

The **title** and **description** are automatically filed from the Markdown content:

```md
# Title of the page

> Description of the page
```

You can overwrite them using the Front-matter:

```md
---
title: Overwritten title
description: Overwritten description
---

# Title of the page

> Description of the page
```
