Let's walk through the creation of a simple introduction page.

## Create the file

With Docus, a page is a Markdown file inside content directory.

```
content/
├─ index.md
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can learn more about the content directory on [this page](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/content-directory).
::

## Configure the page

Specifying [Front-matter](/writing/front-matter) data lets you configure your page data.

Here we want to create a page that uses the `fluid` layout and is not displayed in navigation.

```markdown [index.md]
---
layout: fluid
navigation: false
---
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can learn more about front-matter on [this page](/writing/front-matter).
::

## Use your components

Using our custom syntax, you can easily add and configure components into your pages.

```markdown [index.md]
::block-hero
---
cta:
  - Get started
  - /getting-started

secondary:
  - Open on GitHub →
  - https://github.com/nuxtlabs/docus

snippet: npx nuxi init docus-app -t nuxtlabs/docus-starter
---

#title

#description

```

::alert{type="info"}

## Add Markdown content

Using our custom Prose system, you can use Markdown and customize its rendering with ease.

```markdown [index.md]
::container{padded}
