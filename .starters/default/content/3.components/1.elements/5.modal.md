# Modal

A `Modal` is a component that appears on top of the main content of the page. It is used to display important information or to request user input, while blocking interaction with the rest of the page.

## Focus

By default `Modal` traps focus within it's content while it is open. When the `Modal` is closed, focus is returned to the element that had focus before the `Modal` was opened.

Keep in mind, that `Modal` default slot content should have at least one tabbable node in it. This is required for the focus trap to work properly.
