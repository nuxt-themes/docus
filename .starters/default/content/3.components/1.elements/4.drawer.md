# Drawer

The `Drawer` component is a panel that slides out from the edge of the screen. It can be useful to provide access to destinations in your app without leaving the current page.

## Focus

The `Drawer` component is a modal component. It traps focus within the `Drawer` while it is open. When the drawer is closed, focus is returned to the element that had focus before the `Drawer` was opened.
