# Disclosure

Disclosure is a component that can be used to hide or show content. The disclosure will be hidden by default, but the user can click on the disclosure title to show the content. 

The disclosure title can be customized using the `summary` slot. The disclosure content can be customized using the `content` slot. The disclosure can be opened by default by adding the `open` attribute.

Additionally you can control the `Disclosure` state, by passing `open` and listening `update:open` props (or use `v-model:open`).
