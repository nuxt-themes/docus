# Docs Layout

A layout used for Nuxt Content [Document-driven mode](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/document-driven). 

It's a three-column layout component. Wraps native Nuxt `layouts` `default.vue`. Used for all `content` pages, if they don't have `layout` provided in front-matter.

Consists of aside navigation, main content area and a right sidebar for Table of contents and some additional slots.
